Code Style and Conventions:
- Language: TypeScript with ES modules (import/export)
- Types: Prefer explicit interfaces/types; export interfaces used across files
- Async: Use async/await; avoid callbacks
- Validation: Use Zod schemas for runtime validation
- Structure: Encapsulate domain logic in classes (JetBrains, Project, Issue, Task, Step)
- Utilities: Keep helpers in src/utils; pure and small
- Components: Small functions that return HTML/SVG strings for server-rendered snippets
- Workers: Use poolifier-web-worker; keep worker code isolated under src/workers
- Naming: camelCase for variables/functions; PascalCase for classes; UPPER_SNAKE for constants
- Errors: Surface meaningful messages; validate inputs via schemas before use
- CSS/JS in public/ are build artifacts or simple client helpers; avoid editing generated CSS (public/css/app.css)
- Do not edit dist/ or other build artefacts; make changes in src/
- Follow project guidelines in .junie/guidelines.md where applicable
